title: Refunding Charges
---

### What is this?

In order to get you up and running as quickly as possible, we added the ability to create refunds directly from our Dashboard.


## Create a refund

### The following requirements must be met for a charge to be refundable:

- It must be either `pending` or `closed`
- It must have been `captured`
- It must not be already fully refunded
- It must have been settled within 1 year

First, log in to the dashboard and find the charge you want to refund.

Assuming the charge meets all requirements, you will find the "Refund" button here:

Clicking on it gives you the choice to do a full or partial refund:

That's all there is to it!
