## Requirement

The following requirements must be met for a transfer to be created:

- There must be over 30 THB in your available balance.
- There cannot be another incomplete transfer being processed.

## Recipient

  Each transfer has to be made with a valid recipient. There is 2 types of recipient, individual or corporation.

### Create a recipient

  ```shell
    curl https://api.omise.co/recipients \
    -X POST \
    -u "$OMISE_KEY_SECRET": \
    -d "name=James Smith"
    -d "email=james.smith@example.com"
    -d "description=My first other recipient" \
    -d "recipient_type=individual"
    -d "bank_account[brand]=test" \
    -d "bank_account[bank_account_no]=acc12345" \
    -d "bank_account[bank_account_name]=James Smith"
  ```

### Recipient verification
  
  Normally we take 2-3 days to verify the recipient (existence of bank account number and name). You have to go to your dashboard recipients page to see the list of recipients you have added. There you will be able to see the recipient detail and their verification status.

  Once the recipient has been verified, you have to activate the recipient in order to transfer to.

### Recipient activation

  You can activate the recipient by going to recipient detail and click at "Activate this recipient". The recipient will then ready for the transfer.

## Transfer to default recipient

  There is a auto-created default recipient for each account (both TEST and LIVE) which has a bank account information that the available funds can be transfered to. The TEST recipient is available for you immediately once you sign up with Omise. 

  ```shell
    curl https://api.omise.co/transfers \
      -X POST \
      -u "$OMISE_KEY_SECRET": \
      -d "amount=350000"
  ```

## Transfer to third party recipient

  We also allow transferring funds to third party recipient. See the following command for example 

  ```shell
    curl https://api.omise.co/transfers \
      -X POST \
      -u "$OMISE_KEY_SECRET": \
      -d "amount=350000"
      -d "recipient=recp_test_4z6p7e0m4k40txecj5o"
