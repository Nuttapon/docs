title: Transferring funds
description: This page will guide you how to transfer the available balance to your account or third party recipient
---

## Requirement

The following requirement must be met for a transfer to be created:

- There must be over 30 THB in your available balance.

## Recipient

### Default recipient

  By default, a recipient is created for you in TEST mode once you sign up with Omise. However, once you get your live account, a new live recipient is created for you using your registration information and bank account.

### Third party recipient

  You can create as many recipients as you want. Each recipient has its own bank account information. We allow transferring the balance to these recipient.

### Create a recipient

  The following command demonstrates how to create a recipient using CURL

  ```shell
    curl https://api.omise.co/recipients \
    -X POST \
    -u "$OMISE_KEY_SECRET": \
    -d "name=James Smith"
    -d "email=james.smith@example.com"
    -d "description=My first other recipient" \
    -d "type=individual"
    -d "bank_account[brand]=test" \
    -d "bank_account[number]=acc12345" \
    -d "bank_account[name]=James Smith"
  ```

  By default, recipients are `Inactive` and `non-verified`.
  In order to be operational, recipients have to go through 2 steps:  Verification and Activation. 

  Visit [recipient api](/api/recipients) For more API references.

### Recipient verification
  
  The recipient verification is done by Omise. We normally take 1-2 days for this. The verification result can be either `Verified` or `Failed`.

### Recipient activation

  You can activate recipients independently from the verification process. By default, the recipient is inactive unless you activate it. 
  Activation is done by going to the recipient details and clicking on "Activate the recipient". 
  
  Remember that both activation and verification must be successful before transfers become possible.

## Transfer to default recipient

  Below is a sample code showing how to create a transfer to the default recipient 

  ```shell
    curl https://api.omise.co/transfers \
      -X POST \
      -u "$OMISE_KEY_SECRET": \
      -d "amount=350000"

    # Transfer 3500 THB to default recipient
  ```

## Transfer to third party recipient

  Transferring funds to a third party recipient is similar except that you have to specify the recipient id to transfer to. Here is an example:

  ```shell
    curl https://api.omise.co/transfers \
      -X POST \
      -u "$OMISE_KEY_SECRET": \
      -d "amount=350000"
      -d "recipient=recp_test_4z6p7e0m4k40txecj5o"

    # Transfer 3500 THB to recipient #recp_test_4z6p7e0m4k40txecj5o
  ```

## Transfer timeline

Transfers that are initiated before 11 AM are available in the recipient's bank account within the next business day.
