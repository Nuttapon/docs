description: This page will guide you how to transfer the available balance to your account or third party recipient
---

## Requirement

The following requirements must be met for a transfer to be created:

- There must be over 30 THB in your available balance.
- There cannot be another incomplete transfer being processed.

## Recipient

### Default recipient

  There is already a default recipient created for you in TEST mode once you sign up with Omise. However, once you submit the registration form to go LIVE and got the approval from us, the default recipient for your live account will be created with the bank account information taken from the registration form.

### Third party recipient

  You can create as many recipients as you want, each recipient has its own bank account information. We allow transferring the balance to these recipient.

### Create a recipient

  The following command demonstrates how to create a recipient using CURL

  ```shell
    curl https://api.omise.co/recipients \
    -X POST \
    -u "$OMISE_KEY_SECRET": \
    -d "name=James Smith"
    -d "email=james.smith@example.com"
    -d "description=My first other recipient" \
    -d "type=individual"
    -d "bank_account[brand]=test" \
    -d "bank_account[number]=acc12345" \
    -d "bank_account[name]=James Smith"
  ```

  The recipient status is `Pending` after created. There are 2 further steps to be done before getting to transfer to the recipient, Recipient Verification and Recipient Activation. 

  Visit [recipient api](/api/recipients) For more API referrence

### Recipient verification
  
  Recipient verification is done by Omise. We normally take 1-2 days for this. You can see the recipient detail and their verification status in the dashboard. The verification result can be either `Verified` or `Failed`.

  Once the recipient has been `Verified`, you have to activate it to make it ready for the transfer.

### Recipient activation

  By default, the recipient is inactive unless you activate it. You can do that by going to recipient detail and click at "Activate the recipient". You can then make a transfer to the recipient.

## Transfer to default recipient

  Below is the sample code showing how to create a transfer to the default recipient 

  ```shell
    curl https://api.omise.co/transfers \
      -X POST \
      -u "$OMISE_KEY_SECRET": \
      -d "amount=350000"

    # Transfer 3500 THB to default recipient
  ```

## Transfer to third party recipient

  Transferring funds to third party recipient is similar to transfer to defaut one except that you have to specify the recipient id to transfer to. See the following command for example 

  ```shell
    curl https://api.omise.co/transfers \
      -X POST \
      -u "$OMISE_KEY_SECRET": \
      -d "amount=350000"
      -d "recipient=recp_test_4z6p7e0m4k40txecj5o"

    # Transfer 3500 THB to recipient #recp_test_4z6p7e0m4k40txecj5o
  ```

## Transfer timeline

Transfers will be available in the recipient's bank account in the next business day if the they are initiated before 11 AM.
