title: Balance transfers
---

For those who don't want to implement the [Transfers API](./api/transfers.html), we give the option
to transfer the balance directly from the Dashboard.

## Create a transfer

### The following requirements must be met for a transfer to be created:

- There must be over 30 THB in your available balance.
- There cannot be another incomplete transfer being processed.

First, log in to the dashboard and go to the Transfers menu.

Assuming you meet the requirements, the "Refund" button will be there.

Clicking on it gives you the choice to do a full or partial transfer:

## Testing

In test mode, you can change the transfer status from the dashboard as well.
Open the transfer you want to edit and click on the corresponding button:
