title: Card.js
---
### Getting Started

Card.js is built on top of Omise.js allows you to easily integrate a payment form into your website, tablet or mobile device. Card.js creates an Omise.js token that you can use to create a charge with another Omise API client library (ruby, .net, ...) or with Omise Rest API.

### Integration

Card.js is hosted on Omise CDN (https://cdn.omise.co/card.js). In order to use Card.js below you need to have

* HTML page which contains the checkout form that will post to your server to create a charge
* Server side script for processing posted data. Omise provides numbers of API libraries (ruby, .net, ...) which you can use to implement on your server.

## Example

### Html Form

```html
<html>
...
<body>
<form name="checkoutForm" method="POST" action="checkout">
    <input type="hidden" name="description" value="Product order à¸¿100.25" />
    <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="10025" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://omise-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/card.js"
      data-key="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
      data-image="PATH_TO_LOGO_IMAGE"
      data-name="Merchant site name"
      data-amount="10025">
    </script>
    <!--the script will render <input type="hidden" name="omiseToken"> for you automatically-->
</form>
</body>
</html>
```

Card.js renders a 'Pay now' button on your form. The button triggers a popup which user can enter credit card information.

If you inspect the element in the HTML debugger tool, you will see an additional ```<input type="hidden" name="omiseToken"> ``` element generated by the script. This will be used to handle the token returns from Omise.js.

### Arguments

| Argument   | Value |
|:-----------|:------|
| data-key | **(required)** `data-key` is the public key that you can find in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.omise.co) once you're signed in. |
| data-image | **(required)** `data-image` is the URI to your logo image. eg. `http://example.com/logo.png` |
| data-name | **(required)** `data-name` is the header text you want to show in the credit card popup window |
| data-amount | **(required)** `data-amount` is the amount to be paid in Satangs (100 Satangs = 1 THB) |

### Server side script (using Omise Ruby library)
```ruby

def checkout

 token = params[:omiseToken]
 checkout_description = params[:description]
 checkout_amount = params[:amount]

 charge = Omise::Charge.create({
  return_uri: "https://example.com/orders/384/complete",
  amount: checkout_amount,
  currency: "thb",
  description: checkout_description,
  ip: "127.0.0.1",
  card: token
})

end

```

Upon user submits the credit card information, the Card.js will set the returned card token to 'omiseToken' hidden input and then submit your form automatically.

## Styling the 'Pay now' button

There is no style attached to the generated button. This allows you to freely style it the way you want. We also provides some demos.
