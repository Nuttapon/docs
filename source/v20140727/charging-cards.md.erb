title: Charging Cards
excerpt: This article will highlight how you can charge a credit card
---

All the examples below requires that you first [collect your customer card information](collecting-card-information) in a token. **All tokens are one time use** so you must choose wisely between charging the card directly or if you need to associate that card to a customer for future use.

The main advantage of attaching a card to a customer is that it will let you charge their card more than once. Recurring customers can benefit from not having to type their card details again for every purchase.

## Charging the Card Directly

This is the easiest way to charge a card. Once you receive a card token, you send it to our [charges API](api/charges/) with the amount you want to charge. Within a few seconds the card will have been charged.

Note that the token will be void once it has been used; you won't be able to charge the card or create a customer with it anymore.

Here's an example using the [Omise ruby](https://github.com/omise/omise-ruby) library:

```ruby
charge = Omise::Charge.create({
  amount: 100025,
  currency: "thb",
  description: "Order-345678",
  return_uri: "http://localhost/orders/345678/complete",
  card: params[:omise_token]
})
```

## Charging a Customer

Creating customers with a token will let you charge a card multiple times if needed. With our [customers API](api/customers/) you could create checkout flow where your customer don't have to retype their card information all over again. This decrease dramatically the chance of cart abandonment.

We offer two ways to charge a customer.

### Charging the Default Card

With the default card, you only pass the customer ID. This is useful if you only want to have one card per customer.

Here's an example using the [Omise ruby](https://github.com/omise/omise-ruby) library:

```ruby
charge = Omise::Charge.create({
  amount: 100025,
  currency: "thb",
  description: "Order-345678",
  return_uri: "http://localhost/orders/345678/complete",
  customer: user.omise_customer_id
})
```

### Charging a Specific Card

With a specific card, you pass both a customer ID and the specific card ID. This is particularly useful if you have multiple cards attached to a customer.

Note that unlike [charging a card directly with a token](#charging-the-card-directly) to create the charge you have to pass the actual card ID instead of the token ID. You can read how to [list all customer cards](api/cards#list-all-cards) and the [pagination documentation](api/pagination) to see how to retrieve a list of cards for a specific customer.

Here's an example using the [Omise ruby](https://github.com/omise/omise-ruby) library:

```ruby
charge = Omise::Charge.create({
  amount: 100025,
  currency: "thb",
  description: "Order-345678",
  return_uri: "http://localhost/orders/345678/complete",
  customer: customer.omise_id
  card: customer.cards.find_by(id: params[:id]).omise_id
})
```
