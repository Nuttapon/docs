### Getting Started
This plugin is a Wordpress plugin designed specifically to support for Omise Payment Gateway in WooCommerce.

### Requirement &amp; Dependencies
The plugin was built and tested with Wordpress 4.0.1+ and WooCommerce 2.2.8. The plugin dependencies are jQuery and [Omise.js](https://cdn.omise.co/omise.js) library.
You will also need [Omise account](https://dashboard.omise.co/signup).

### Installation
Get our [Omise-WooCommerce](https://github.com/omise/omise-woocommerce) plugin that is available on github.  (Note that at the moment,  this plugin has not been added to Wordpress Plugin Directory yet).

After getting the source code,  either downloading as a zip or git clone,  put it in Wordpress plugins folder (i.e. `mv omise-woocommerce <wordpress installed path>/wp-content/plugins/`  or upload a zip via Wordpress admin Plugins section,  just like the other Wordpress plugins).

Then, Omise Gateway Wordpress plugin should be appeared in Wordpress admin page, under the Plugins menu.

From there:

* Go to `WooCommerce -> Settings`
* Select the `Checkout` tab on top.
* Select `Omise payment gateway` at the bottom of the page, under `Payment Gateways`.
* Optionally, if you'd like to have Omise Payment gateway as a default payment gateway, you can check `Default`.
* Click the `Settings` button and adjust the options as follow:

| Setting             | Description |
|:-------------------------|:------|
| `Enable/Disable`          | Enables or disables 'Omise Payment Module' |
| `Sandbox`                 | If selected, all transactions will be performed in TEST mode and TEST keys will be used |
| `Title`                   | Title of Omise Payment gateway shown at checkout |

Your customers can select `Omise payment gateway` from the checkout page. Please note that the card name, number, expiry date and security code are required.
Upon clicking the PLACE ORDER button, a card token will be generated and used to create a charge in your Omise account.

The logged in user can save their card if required. In that case, the plugin will create an Omise Customer associated to your WooCommerce account.

In case you have returning customers with saved credit cards, they can select one of their cards at checkout.
