### Getting Started
This plugin is a Wordpress plugin designed specifically to add support for Omise Payment Gateway in WooCommerce.

### Requirement &amp; Dependencies
The plugin was built and tested with Wordpress 4.0.1 and WooCommerce 2.2.8. The plugin dependencies are jQuery and [Omise.js](https://cdn.omise.co/omise.js) library.
You will also need an Omise account.

### Installation
You can grab the source from our [Omise-WooCommerce](https://github.com/omise/omise-woocommerce) repository on github. At this time, the plugin is not yet available on Wordpress' plugin directory.

After downloading or cloning the repository, upload or copy the whole folder to your wordpress installation 'plugins' folder ( `../wp-content/plugins` ).
'Omise Gateway Wordpress plugin' should then appear in Wordpress, under the Plugins menu.

From there:

* Go to WooCommerce -> Settings
* Select the 'Checkout' tab on top. Select 'Omise payment gateway' at the bottom of the page, under 'Payment Gateways'.
* Optionally, you can check 'Default' if you want to make Omise Payment gateway the default choice.
* Click on the 'Settings' button and adjust the options as follow:

| Setting             | Description |
|:-------------------------|:------|
| `Enable/Disable`          | Enables or disables 'Omise Payment Module' |
| `Sandbox`                 | If selected, all transactions will be performed in TEST mode and TEST keys will be used |
| `Title`                   | Title of Omise Payment gateway shown at checkout |
| `Description`             | Description of Omise Payment Gateway shown at checkout |
| `Private key for test`    | Your TEST secret key. It can be found in [your Dashboard](https://dashboard.omise.co/test/api-keys). |
| `Public key for test`     | Your TEST public key. It can be found in [your Dashboard](https://dashboard.omise.co/test/api-keys). |
| `Private key for live`    | Your LIVE secret key. It can be found in [your Dashboard](https://dashboard.omise.co/live/api-keys). |
| `Public key for live`     | Your LIVE public key. It can be found in [your Dashboard](https://dashboard.omise.co/live/api-keys). |

Once everything is set up, click 'Save changes'.

  Your customers can select 'Omise payment gateway' from the checkout page. Please note that the card name, number, expiry date and security code are required.
  Upon clicking the PLACE ORDER button, a card token will be generated and used to create a charge in your Omise account.

  The logged in user can save their card if required. In that case, the plugin will create an Omise Customer associated to your WooCommerce account.

  In case you have returning customers with saved credit cards, they can select one of their cards at checkout.

### Manage the cards
